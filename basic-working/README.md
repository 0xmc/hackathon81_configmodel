NANOG 81 Hackathon - Configuration Modeling

This is a sample project to serve as a basic configuration modeling and software design tutorial.

The code is intended for educational purposes only and is in no way intended for production use.

## What's in this directory
This is the `basic-working` directory, which contains a basic, working system.  You can expand on this, though you may which to copy this directory in your own project directory next to `hack` and `basic-working`.

If you're trying to get to a basic, working system from scratch (well, from a skeleton), you probably want to be looking at the [hack](../hack) directory. 

## What this basic, working system does
1. Implements interface and BGP peer configuration schemas
2. Implements templates for interface and BGP peer configuration rendering for two vendors
3. Contains a RESTful API
4. Contains logic for backbone link and PNI services
5. Persists configs and services to a database
